		<div class="subheader"<i>Select a country from the map to display detailed country data.</i><br><br><b>Disclaimer</b><br>To enhance international comparability, the ILO applied a systematic approach to measuring informal employment when processing micro data. All estimates are based on a common set of operational criteria to determine informal employment and employment in the informal sector. As a result, statistics presented here are comparable across countries and regions, but the ILOâ€™s country estimates might differ from national ones when they exist.</div>
